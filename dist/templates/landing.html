                                I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, with an Advanced Software Developer Certificate. I completed this degree in March of 2016. I am also continuing to learn and better myself as a front-end developer moving towards full-stack web developer.
                                My journey has brought me to enroll at Bloc Coding boot-camp a program that has allowed me to learn by developing in a real world type of scenarios, but I also feel that I have so much more to learn.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am very passionate about learning to develop, everyone uses the web and applications for all sorts of things and being a web developer I will be an architect that gives people the tools they need to explore, communicate, and create through any medium
                                they choose.
